Library for creating simple monitoring plugins in Go

The aim with this project is to compile with the guidelines defined here: https://www.monitoring-plugins.org/doc/guidelines.html as well as streamline process in making a monitoring plugin to the point where you only need to define the check it self and not have to worry about handling CLI options, arguments etc as well as worrying about returning valid performance data.
